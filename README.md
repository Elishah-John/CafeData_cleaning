# ☕ Café Data Cleaning Project

This project focuses on cleaning and preparing real-world café transaction data for analysis. The raw dataset included pricing inconsistencies, missing timestamps, and messy categorical fields. Using Python and `pandas`, I built a robust and reusable cleaning pipeline to transform the noisy data into a structured, analysis-ready format.

## 🔧 Features
- Conversion of numeric columns
- Parsed and normalized date/time values
- Handled missing data
- Stripped and cleaned string fields for consistent formatting
- Automated cleaning with a `clean_dataframe()` utility function


## 🚀 Use Cases
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Dashboarding (e.g., Power BI, Tableau)
- Machine learning pipelines
- Teaching or demo datasets

##📌 Why This Matters

Clean data is the foundation of every good insight. While this project is built on café transactions, the techniques apply to nearly all real-world datasets. Every scraped CSV, every messy Excel file — they all need cleaning before they mean anything.

Feel free to fork, clone, or use the `clean_dataframe()` function in your own projects.
